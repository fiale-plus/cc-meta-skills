# Discover Project Skills

## Overview

This skill analyzes your codebase to automatically discover:
1. **Technologies used**: Frameworks, databases, messaging systems, API protocols
2. **Project-specific patterns**: Architecture flows, module organization, design patterns
3. **Contextual skills**: Generates reusable skill files that chain together

**When to use:**
- Starting work on a new codebase
- After major architectural changes
- When onboarding to a project
- To document project patterns as skills

**Output:**
- Technology skills (e.g., `kafka-patterns.md`, `grpc-best-practices.md`)
- Project skills (e.g., `api-layer-patterns.md`, `service-layer-patterns.md`)
- Saved to `.claude/skills/` for automatic discovery

## Phase 0: Pre-check Existing Skills

**Before generating skills, check for existing generated skills:**

1. Check if `.claude/skills/` directory exists in current working directory
2. If exists, scan for files containing marker: `<!-- Generated by discover-project-skills -->`
3. Count existing generated skills

**If existing skills found:**
- Present to user: "Found N existing skills: [list names]"
- Ask using AskUserQuestion tool:
  ```
  Question: "How should I proceed with existing skills?"
  Options:
    - Regenerate All: Delete all existing generated skills and create fresh
    - Update Specific: Ask which areas to regenerate, keep others
    - Cancel: Exit without making changes
  ```

**If .claude/skills/ doesn't exist:**
- Create directory: `mkdir -p .claude/skills`
- Inform user: "Created .claude/skills/ directory for generated skills"

**Error handling:**
- Cannot create directory → Suggest alternative location or check permissions
- Cannot read existing skills → Warn user, offer to continue without checking
